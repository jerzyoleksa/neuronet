Neural networks and the Math behind it

1. neural networks let you find a structure that will describe your input and ouput data; you build a calculating brain that will be able to repeat the same calculation for the next input. In that sense NN is a team work, as there is no one simple equation that you will come up with.
2. when designing NN, you have some rough idea about which activation function would fit it, but it is the the combination of weights and function ouput that give you a true "intelligence" of the network
